- **Bug fixes** — PRs are welcome.
- **New features or architectural changes** — please start with a Discord conversation in #clawhub first so we can align on scope.

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (Convex CLI runs via `bunx`, no global install needed)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18, 20, 22, or 24 (required by the local Convex backend; v25+ is not yet supported)

### Install and configure

```bash
bun install
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with the following values for **local Convex**:

```bash
# Frontend
VITE_CONVEX_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3210
VITE_CONVEX_SITE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3211
SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Convex Auth / HTTP routes
CONVEX_SITE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3211

# Deployment used by `bunx convex dev`
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=anonymous:anonymous-clawhub
```

Local Convex serves the function endpoint on port 3210 and HTTP routes (`/api/*` and auth callbacks) through the site proxy on port 3211.

### GitHub OAuth App (for login)

1. Go to [github.com/settings/developers](https://github.com/settings/developers) and create a new OAuth App.
2. Set **Homepage URL** to `http://localhost:3000`.
3. Set **Authorization callback URL** to `http://127.0.0.1:3211/api/auth/callback/github`.
4. Copy the Client ID and generate a Client Secret.

### Run the Convex backend

Start the local Convex backend first — other setup steps depend on it:

```bash
bunx convex dev --typecheck=disable
```

### Set backend environment variables

The Convex backend has its own env var store separate from `.env.local`. With the backend running, open a new terminal and set the required variables:

```bash
bunx convex env set AUTH_GITHUB_ID <your-client-id>
bunx convex env set AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET <your-client-secret>
bunx convex env set SITE_URL http://localhost:3000
```

### JWT keys (for Convex Auth)

With the backend still running, generate the signing keys:

```bash
bunx @convex-dev/auth
```

This sets `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` and `JWKS` on the Convex backend and outputs values you can also save to `.env.local` for reference.

### Run the frontend

```bash
bun run dev -- --port 3000
```

Change the port if 3000 is already in use, and update `SITE_URL` in both `.env.local` and the Convex backend (`bunx convex env set SITE_URL ...`) to match.

### Seed the database

Populate shared `@local` sample skills, plugins, and scanner fixtures so the UI is not empty:

```bash
bun run seed:dev
```

The script waits for the local Convex deployment, runs the fixture seed, and refreshes global stats.
If you need to run the pieces manually:

```bash
# Skills, plugins, and moderation/scanner fixtures
bunx convex run --no-push devSeed:seedNixSkills

# 50 extra skills for pagination testing (optional)
bunx convex run --no-push devSeedExtra:seedExtraSkillsInternal

# Refresh cached global stats after manual seeding
bunx convex run --no-push statsMaintenance:updateGlobalStatsAction
```

To reset and re-seed:

```bash
bunx convex run --no-push devSeed:seedNixSkills '{"reset": true}'
bunx convex run --no-push statsMaintenance:updateGlobalStatsAction
```

### Optional environment variables

These features degrade gracefully without their keys:

| Variable                                                                  | Purpose                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`                                                          | Embeddings and vector search (falls back to zero vectors) |
| `VT_API_KEY`                                                              | VirusTotal malware scanning                               |
| `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`                                                     | Discord notifications                                     |
| `GITHUB_APP_ID` / `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` / `GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID` | GitHub backup sync                                        |

### Local development paths

After the initial setup above, pick the path that fits your workflow:

**Path A — Manual two-terminal**
Keep full control over the Convex backend and the Vite dev server independently.

```bash
# terminal A
bunx convex dev --typecheck=disable

# terminal B
bun run dev -- --port 3000
```

**Path B — One-command worktree**
Start the backend, wait for it, then start the app in a single process. Useful for detached worktrees or CI/automation environments.

```bash
bun run dev:worktree
```

Options:

- `--seed` — seed fixtures after the backend starts
- `--detach` — run in the background (logs to `.clawhub/dev-worktree.log`)
- `--port <n>` — change the Vite port (default `3000`)
- `--env-file <path>` — point to a shared `.env.local` outside the worktree

**Seed**
Populate or refresh `@local` fixtures and global stats:

```bash
bun run seed:dev
```

This is equivalent to `dev:worktree --seed-only`.

**Local auth e2e**
Run Playwright specs under `e2e/local-auth/` against an isolated local backend with dev auth enabled:

```bash
bunx playwright install chromium
bun run test:pw:local-auth
```

The runner temporarily moves aside `.env.local` and `.convex/local/default`, then restores them afterward. Stop any running local Convex before starting it.

To run a single spec:

```bash
bun run test:pw:local-auth -- --project=chromium e2e/local-auth/<spec>.pw.test.ts
```

### Troubleshooting

| Issue                              | Fix                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Port already in use                | Change the port with `bun run dev -- --port <n>` and update `SITE_URL` in `.env.local` and the Convex backend. |
| `.env.local` missing in a worktree | `dev:worktree` auto-detects the primary worktree's `.env.local`, or pass `--env-file <path>`.                  |
| Playwright browser missing         | `bunx playwright install chromium`                                                                             |

## CLI Development

The CLI source lives in [`packages/clawhub/`](packages/clawhub/). Both `clawhub` and `clawdhub` are registered as bin aliases.

To test the CLI against your local instance:

```bash
CLAWHUB_REGISTRY=http://127.0.0.1:3211 CLAWHUB_SITE=http://localhost:3000 clawhub search "padel"
```

Use the package-local verification contract when working on the CLI:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/clawhub test
bun run --cwd packages/clawhub verify:build
bun run --cwd packages/clawhub test:artifact
bun run --cwd packages/clawhub verify
```

`bun test packages/clawhub/` is not the supported workflow. Source tests and built-artifact smoke tests are intentionally split.

Manual smoke tests are documented in [`specs/manual-testing.md`](specs/manual-testing.md).

## Skill & Soul Publishing

- Skill format reference: [`docs/skill-format.md`](docs/skill-format.md)
- Soul format reference: [`docs/soul-format.md`](docs/soul-format.md)
- End-to-end walkthrough (search, install, publish, sync): [`docs/quickstart.md`](docs/quickstart.md)

Quick publish:

```bash
clawhub publish <path-to-skill-directory>
```

## Before Submitting a PR

```bash
bun run format:check # oxfmt
bun run lint       # oxlint
bun run deadcode:ci # Knip files/deps/exports
bun run test       # Vitest (80% coverage threshold)
bun run build      # Vite + Nitro
bun run --cwd packages/clawhub verify
```

These are the same checks that run in CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

### Crabbox remote checks

Maintainers can run the same checks in a Crabbox lease instead of spending local
CPU. ClawHub uses Crabbox as the agent-facing command surface; the Testbox
workflow is only the backend for the default Blacksmith provider.

```bash
bun run crabbox:warmup -- --provider blacksmith-testbox
bun run crabbox:run -- --provider blacksmith-testbox --shell -- "bun run lint"
bun run crabbox:run -- --provider blacksmith-testbox --shell -- "bun run test"
bun run crabbox:run -- --provider blacksmith-testbox --shell -- "bun run build"
```

Use `--id <id-or-slug>` with `crabbox:run` when reusing an existing warmed lease,
and stop disposable leases with `bun run crabbox:stop -- --provider <provider>
<id-or-slug>`.
Use `CLAWHUB_LOCAL_CHECK_MODE=throttled` or `CLAWHUB_LOCAL_CHECK_MODE=full` as
the explicit local escape hatch when you intentionally want laptop-side proof.
If Crabbox auth/provider access is missing, report that instead of falling back
to a broad local gate that can bog down a dev machine.
